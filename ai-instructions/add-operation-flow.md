# Add operation flow

/Users/victorjeman/work/victor/frontend/app/api/agents/route.ts

- Create the form for adding a new operation
- use the model of shadcn form and check the site https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form for tips
- The schema for each form should be inside a "features/[feature-name]/schemas/[form-name]-schema.ts"
- Use zod for schema validation
- After completing the form and the button Save is pressed, update the database with the new version, and use the endpoints, and not the direct connection to the database
- The form should be in a modal
- Organize the layout and the style accordingly to the layout and the style of the entire app
